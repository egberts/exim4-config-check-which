# exim4-config-check-which
Determine which set of configuration files are being used by Exim4 mail server on Debian OS distro.

Setting up Exim4 mail server?  

Got tired of guessing WHICH file to edit?  

Even after reading the 'man update-exim4.conf' manpage ... repeatedly?


Naming convention could have been more intuitive.  Such as:

*  `update-exim4.conf` could be better named as `update-exim4-conf` (or `update-exim4`)
* `update-exim4.conf.conf` could be better named as `exim4.debian.conf`: then we would know which one to go to `exim4.conf`/`exim4.debian.conf`.
* `update-exim4.conf.template` ... whew ... could have been `exim4.debian.template`.
* `/var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated` could have beeen `/var/lib/exim4/exim4.conf.autogenerated`.

This helpful but informative script only works on Debian OS distro.  Errors out nicely otherwise.

A run example for the split-configuration method of Exim4 configuration files:
```console
$ ./exim4-config-check-which.sh
Determine which configs file that Exim4 is using.

Compiled-in config lookup sequence by /usr/sbin/exim4:
Configuration file search path is /etc/exim4/exim4.conf:/var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
Configuration file is /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
/usr/sbin/exim4 is now using this config file:

That is all.
