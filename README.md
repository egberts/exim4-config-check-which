# exim4-config-check-which
Determine which set of configuration files are being used by Exim4 mail server on Debian OS distro.

Setting up Exim4 mail server?  

Got tired of guessing WHICH file to edit?  

Even after reading the 'man update-exim4.conf' manpage ... repeatedly?

This helpful but informative script will tell you which config file(s) are being
used for your current setup; only works on Debian OS distro.  Even errors out nicely otherwise.

Weird Naming Convention
=======================

Naming convention could have been more intuitive.  Such as:

*  `update-exim4.conf` could be better named as `update-exim4-conf` (or `update-exim4`)
* `update-exim4.conf.conf` could be better named as `exim4.debian.conf`: then we would know which one to go to `exim4.conf`/`exim4.conf.debian`.
* `update-exim4.conf.template` ... whew ... could have been `exim4.conf.template.debian`.
* `/var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated` could have beeen `/var/lib/exim4/exim4.conf.autogenerated`.

Debian Split-Configuration
==========================
A run example for the split-configuration method of Exim4 configuration files:
```console
# ~/bin/exim4-config-check-which.sh 
Determine which configs file that Exim4 is using.

Compiled-in config lookup sequence by /usr/sbin/exim4:
Configuration file search path is /etc/exim4/exim4.conf:/var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
Configuration file is /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
/usr/sbin/exim4 is now using this config file:
              /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated

Reading /etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf for its settings ...
'dc_use_split_config' is set to 'true' in /etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf
  ignores          : /etc/exim4/exim4.conf
  ignores          : /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template

  reads from       : /etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf
  reads from       : /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.localmacros
  writes to        : /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
  daemon reads from: /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
```

Debian Non-Split-Configuration
==============================
If using Debian non-split configuration, then:
```console
# ~/bin/exim4-config-check-which.sh 
Determine which configs file that Exim4 is using.

Compiled-in config lookup sequence by /usr/sbin/exim4:
Configuration file search path is /etc/exim4/exim4.conf:/var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
Configuration file is /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
/usr/sbin/exim4 is now using this config file:
              /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated

Reading /etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf for its settings ...
'dc_use_split_config' is set to 'false' in /etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf
  ignores          : /etc/exim4/exim4.conf
  ignores          : /etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf
  ignores          : /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.localmacros

  reads from       : /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template
  writes to        : /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
  daemon reads from: /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
```

Debian has `/etc/exim4/exim4.conf` file
=======================================
If a Debian is missing `/etc/update-exim4.conf.conf` but has the required `/etc/exim4/exim4.conf`, then:
```console
# bash exim4-config-check-which.sh 
Determine which configs file that Exim4 is using.

Compiled-in config lookup sequence by /usr/sbin/exim4:
2022-03-25 13:14:38 Warning: purging the environment.
 Suggested action: use keep_environment.
Configuration file search path is /etc/exim4/exim4.conf:/var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
Configuration file is /etc/exim4/exim4.conf
/usr/sbin/exim4 is now using this config file:
              /etc/exim4/exim4.conf

Exim4 daemon will:
  Ignores          : /etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf
  Ignores          : /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template
  Ignores          : /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.localmacros
(update-exim4.conf writes nothing)

  daemon reads from: /etc/exim4/exim4.conf
```

`/etc/exim4/exim4.conf` AND `/var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated`
================================================================
If a Debian had been transitioned to `exim.conf` but left an
artifact file behind that is named `/var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated`, then
```console
# ~/bin/exim4-config-check-which.sh 
Determine which configs file that Exim4 is using.

Compiled-in config lookup sequence by /usr/sbin/exim4:
2022-03-25 13:28:04 Warning: purging the environment.
 Suggested action: use keep_environment.
Configuration file search path is /etc/exim4/exim4.conf:/var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
Configuration file is /etc/exim4/exim4.conf
/usr/sbin/exim4 is now using this config file:
              /etc/exim4/exim4.conf

Exim4 daemon will:

  Ignores          : /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template
  Ignores          : /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.localmacros
(update-exim4.conf writes nothing)

  daemon reads from: /etc/exim4/exim4.conf

WARNING: there is a lingering Debian artifact file that needs removing:
    /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
```

Debian host is missing both `/etc` files
========================================

If both config files are missing but ...
the `/var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated` exists, then
```console
# ~/bin/exim4-config-check-which.sh 
Determine which configs file that Exim4 is using.

Compiled-in config lookup sequence by /usr/sbin/exim4:
Configuration file search path is /etc/exim4/exim4.conf:/var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
Configuration file is /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
/usr/sbin/exim4 is now using this config file:
              /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated

WARNING: No configuration files found in /etc/exim4 directory.
WARNING: Exim4 daemon using the following UNKNOWN config file:
    /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated
```

That is all.
